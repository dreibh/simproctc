In OMNeT++ 4.1, the .ini file parameter "vector-recording-interval" has been
renamed to "vector-recording-intervals"! This example assumes OMNeT++ 4.1, it
will therefore fail under version 4.0

To use this example under OMNeT++ 4.0, open simulate-version1.R and replace:
"vector-recording-intervals" -> "vector-recording-interval"!
