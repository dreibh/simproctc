ld-loader:
   Avoid using existing shared libraries. Problem:
   Out-of-Date OMNeT++ files in search path -> will be used instead of work-package provided files!
   => FIXED! -> using "env -i ..."

Garbage in /tmp after aborting simulation:
   Use per work-package temp directory instead of /tmp
   => FIXED!
